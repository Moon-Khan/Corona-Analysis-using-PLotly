# Corona Analysis using Plotly

## Introduction

This repository contains code for analyzing Corona-related data using Plotly, a powerful Python library for interactive data visualization. The analysis includes sentiment analysis of tweets related to the Coronavirus, geographical analysis of its impact, and tracking tweet volume over time. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from a PostgreSQL database.

## Installation

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/corona-analysis-using-plotly.git
    ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries:**

    ```
    pip install pandas psycopg2 plotly dash
    ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL:**

    - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
    - Create a database (e.g., "Corona_NLP_db").
    - Execute the provided Python code to import the dataset into the PostgreSQL database.

## Analysis Overview

Understanding the data is our first step. With the Corona dataset in hand, our initial task involves cleansing the data by eliminating null values to ensure data integrity. Subsequently, we import the refined data into a PostgreSQL database, facilitating real-time updates for our dashboard. Leveraging libraries such as Dash, Dash Core Components (DCC), Dash HTML Components (HTML), and Dash dependencies, we craft an interactive dashboard equipped with key visualizations:

- **Sentiment Distribution:** Delving into sentiment analysis of Corona-related tweets, we unveil the public sentiment towards the pandemic. This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of emotional responses, offering insights into societal reactions.

- **Location Analysis:** By mapping geographical data, we highlight the global impact of the Coronavirus across various regions. This analysis discerns pandemic hotspots and sheds light on the areas most profoundly affected.

- **Tweet Volume Over Time:** Tracking the volume of Corona-related tweets over time, we discern temporal patterns in public discourse. This visualization enables us to grasp evolving trends and reactions throughout the pandemicâ€™s timeline.

- **Wordcloud:** Employing a word cloud, we extract prevalent themes and topics from Corona-related tweets. This visualization offers deeper insights into the public discourse surrounding the pandemic.

## Conclusion

Analyzing Corona-related data using Plotly provides valuable insights into public sentiment, geographical impact, and temporal trends. By leveraging interactive visualizations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the societal response to the pandemic and inform decision-making processes.
